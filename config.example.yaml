# Validation settings
validation:
  # Quick checks (fast, catches obvious issues)

  max_duration_hours: 12  # Flag files claiming to be longer than this

  # Bitrate sanity checks
  check_bitrate: true

  # Deep validation (slower, catches corruption)
  deep_scan_enabled: true
  # Decode first, middle, and last X seconds of file

  # Full decode (very slow, most thorough)
  full_decode_enabled: false  # Only enable if you have CPU to spare

# Background scanner settings
scanner:
  enabled: true
  # How many files to scan per hour (throttling)
  # At 100 files/hour, a 50,000 file library takes ~3 weeks for initial scan

  files_per_hour: 100

  # Mode:
  #   "watch_only" - Scan library once, then only validate new imports (recommended for large libraries)
  #   "continuous" - Keep re-scanning forever (catches files that become corrupted over time)
